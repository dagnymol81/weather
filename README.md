# What's the Weather?

What's the Weather? is a simple weather forecasting website. Weather forecast data comes directly from the [National Weather Service API](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api).

## Goal and Audience

What's the Weather? was inspired by conversations with my kids during breakfast. Weather information helps us choose the right clothes, pick out a coat, and decide on accessories. What's the Weather? provides a simple interface focused on providing the most relevant information. Because 'What's the Weather?' relies on National Weather Service data, it is US-only.

## Technology

"What's the Weather?" was built with JavaScript, HTML and CSS. For the React/Bootstrap version, checkout the "react" branch.
